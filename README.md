## Step 1: Advanced Ontology Engineering

During building the ontology, vocabularies of three external ontologies that were needed for this domain were reused, which I present in the next:
* BBC food ontology: https://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/fo
* International Contact Ontology: http://ontology.eil.utoronto.ca/icontact.html#d4e383
* Good Relation Ontology: http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1.html

Furthermore, advanced modelling features offered by OWL2 and different Ontology Design Patterns are used during this step.

## Step 2: KG creation through OBDA
## Step 3: Verification of Semantic Structure
## Step 4: Ontology Alignment
